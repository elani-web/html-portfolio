<h3>Malcom in the middle</h3>

<p>I love how chaotic the family was and still found a way to be there for each other. It's funny too</p>

<h3>Two broke girls</h3>

<p>Another funny sitcom. Once again just goes on and on about nice friends who stick togethehr in hard times and find a way to laugh</p>

<h3>Blacklist</h3>

<p>I have a huge crush on Raymond Red Reddington lol. It was a great movie too</p>
